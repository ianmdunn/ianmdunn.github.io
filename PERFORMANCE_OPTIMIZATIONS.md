# Performance Optimizations for Yale Endowment Page

## Overview
This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented to speed up loading and improve user experience on the wide Yale endowment visualization page.

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Resource Loading Optimizations
- **Critical CSS**: Created `critical.css` with essential styles that load first
- **Font Optimization**: Added `display=swap` to Google Fonts for faster perceived loading
- **Resource Hints**: Added `preconnect` and `dns-prefetch` for external resources
- **Preloading**: Preload critical images and CSS files
- **Script Loading**: Added `defer` attribute to main JavaScript for non-blocking loading

### 2. CSS Performance Improvements
- **Pre-calculated Values**: Replaced complex CSS calculations with pre-calculated values
- **Reduced Calculations**: Eliminated expensive `calc()` functions in CSS variables
- **Optimized Variables**: Simplified CSS custom properties for better performance

### 3. JavaScript Performance Enhancements
- **Throttled Scroll Events**: Used `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth scroll handling
- **Passive Event Listeners**: Added `passive: true` to scroll and touch events
- **DocumentFragment**: Used for efficient DOM manipulation when creating infoboxes
- **Lazy Loading**: Added `loading="lazy"` to images in dynamic content
- **Reduced Console Logging**: Removed excessive debug logging

### 4. Configuration Loading Optimizations
- **Timeout Protection**: Added 3-second timeout for configuration file loading
- **Parallel Loading**: Load dynamic CSS and HTML files in parallel
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for missing configuration files
- **LocalStorage Caching**: Prioritize cached configuration for faster loading

### 5. Memory and CPU Optimizations
- **Event Throttling**: Prevent excessive scroll event processing
- **Efficient DOM Queries**: Reduced redundant element lookups
- **Cleanup**: Removed unnecessary debug code and console logs

## Performance Monitoring
- Added `performance.js` script to track loading times and scroll performance
- Monitors memory usage and scroll event frequency
- Provides console logging for performance metrics

## Expected Improvements
- **Faster Initial Load**: Critical CSS loads first, improving perceived performance
- **Smoother Scrolling**: Throttled events prevent scroll lag
- **Reduced Memory Usage**: Optimized DOM manipulation and event handling
- **Better Mobile Performance**: Passive event listeners improve touch responsiveness

## Testing
To test performance improvements:
1. Open browser developer tools
2. Check the Console tab for performance metrics
3. Monitor scroll smoothness during horizontal scrolling
4. Test on both desktop and mobile devices

## Notes
- All mathematical calculations and visual representations remain unchanged
- The wide page layout and scaling logic are preserved
- Configuration system continues to work as before
- Backward compatibility maintained
