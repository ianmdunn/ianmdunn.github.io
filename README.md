# About

This is a clone of [https://github.com/MKorostoff/1-pixel-wealth](https://github.com/MKorostoff/1-pixel-wealth), originally created by [Matt Korostoff](https://github.com/MKorostoff); all credit should be directed there. 

In this version, I have adapted the visualization to focus on Yale University's endowment instead of individual wealth. The original visualization showed Elon Musk's wealth of $240.7 billion, but this version shows Yale's endowment of $40.7 billion to scale. I have also updated the broader context to compare against all US university endowments ($800 billion) rather than the 400 richest Americans.
